# p-vernon-portfolio

A hybrid blog/portfolio to talk about my work. 

## Install and usage 

The site was built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Pages for blog entries are automatically generated from markdown files and images are served from amazon S3. 

Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

Run `gatsby develop` to run in development mode. 

Running gatsby on Windows may requires some extra work. Have a look at [Gastsby on Windows](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-on-windows/) to set up your environment. 

## Live Site

The live site is hosted on [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/) at http://www.vernonlillies.com/
