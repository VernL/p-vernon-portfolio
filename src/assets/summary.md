My name is Vernon Lillies and I'm a full-stack JavaScript developer based in Montreal. I specialize in building high-performance web apps with React and Vue backed by Node/Express APIâ€™s. I'm also skilled at using modern site generators such as Gatsby and Nuxt to bootstrap projects.
 
I have a background in civil engineering and also enjoy making data visualisations, building drones and hacking with raspberry pi. 

I invite you to browse my projects and to get in touch!
